# OriginalCharacterApp
CSE248 Possible Project Idea
### OriginalCharacterApp ###
This is my app that is going to be based on Original Character development such as adding the name, species, gender, personality, age, family history, and bio. My original plan was supposed to be a personality quiz, but it wouldn't fit with the subject.
# ---Udacity Video plans and Ideas---- #
- Stage 1: Learning user interfaces -*Finished watching, but still playing around*-
- Stage 2: User input - started watching
- Stage 3: Multiscreens
Login screen, homepage, create account page, search user page, view user page, click on image/character page to view the user's content.
- Stage 4: Networking
If networking is chosen, there will be comments and faves/likes involved user's submission
- Stage 5: Database
The database will include the user's list of characters that he/she created, the faves(network), and comments(network).
# ----End of Udacity Video Plans--- #
# --- My Plan: --- #
I will develop an app that is going to help other artists/author to keep information about their fictional characters based on their profile/biography. It will be similar to charahub.com, but with more simple interfaces. It will allow users to create their characters and submit them into the network for other users to see.

# User will have to login with email and password plus, a made up username. #
