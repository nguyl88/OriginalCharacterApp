The design pattern is Model View Controller. The model are the users, characters, and likes (not implemented yet). The view are the interfaces which are the xml files. The bottom navigation view holds five different fragments to display different activities for the user to interact. The fragment IS an activity, but they are different than activity, but much complicated to implement. 

# --- Inspiration --- #
-Character Planner App (from google play store), Instagram Clone (CodingWithMitch), PhotoBlog, charahub.com

 # Other features that I would like to add but no time for  #
 -Comment feature
 
 -Hashtag feature (to search for characters instead of users) and the entire post would change by adding a username with likes.
 
 -Follow other user feature
 
 -Notification feature
 
 -Adding a limit for the number of characters that the user can submit.

 
 ***The Project is out-of-date. It needs to update to the latest version of Android Studio***
