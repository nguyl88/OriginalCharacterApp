# OriginalCharacterApp
CSE248 Possible Project Idea
### OriginalCharacterApp ###
This is my app that is going to be based on Original Character development such as adding the name, species, gender, personality, age, family history, and bio. My original plan was supposed to be a personality quiz, but it wouldn't fit with the subject.
# ---Plan---- #
-INTERFACES - Users will have the ability to create an account and login to start creating their own charactes into the database.
-DATA STRUCTURE - The data will be stored on a relational databases like MY SQL or Firebase. 
The database will include the user's list of characters that he/she create and the likes that will act as a bookmark.
-NETWORKING - Parse server or Firebase/MySQL may be use.

There will be no API/Comments in this project.

# --- My Plan: --- #
I will develop an app that is going to help other artists/author to keep information about their fictional characters based on their profile/biography. It will be similar to charahub.com, animo, and instagram. It will allow users to create their characters and submit them into the network for other users to see.

# User will have to login with email and password plus, a made up username. #
